# Origin

*A WordPress starter theme*

Loosely based on the [_s](https://github.com/Automattic/_s) theme, Origin's goal is to provide a useful set of base styles and functionality to get started quickly building themes for client projects, without bringing along all of the bloat of full frontend frameworks like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

Origin is not intended to be a framework, but a starter theme which contains the code that is typically the same across projects, giving you a base to quickly begin building the client-specific portions of the theme.

Origin differs from _s in that it provides a fuller set of base styling, plus a number of other useful features like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), asset minification, a modular scale for typography and spacing, and reorganization of template files in the manner that I prefer.
